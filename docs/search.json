    "text": "Central tendency is an important statistical measure of quantitative data. It identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution of the collected data. The Mean, Median, and Mode are three of the common ways to measure central tendency. Other measurements, such as a trimmed Mean, weighted Mean, geometric Mean, and harmonic Mean, are not covered in this course.\n\n\nThe most used measure of central tendency is the Mean. The average of the data is the Mean. It is computed by adding all the values in the data set divided by the number of observations in it. Extreme values can easily alter the Mean, which is one of the Mean’s shortcomings. i.e. sensitive to extreme values.\nTo calculate the Mean, you first add all the numbers together (3 + 11 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 6 = 47). Then you divide the total sum by the number of scores used (47 / 7 = 6.7). In this example, the Mean or average of the number set is 6.7.\nUse the Mean to describe the sample with a single value that represents the center of the data. Many statistical analyses use the Mean as a standard measure of the center of the distribution of the data. The Median and the Mean both measure central tendency.\n\n\n\nThe Median is the value in the ordered data that is in the middle. The most critical step in calculating the Median is to arrange the data in ascending order from least to largest. Extreme values can not easily alter the Median. i.e. resistant to extreme values. When the dataset contains an even number of values, then the Median value of the dataset can be found by taking the Mean of the middle two values\n\n\n\nThe Mode is the most often occurring value in the data. It’s crucial to keep in mind that the dataset could have multiple Modes. Extreme values can not easily alter the Mode. i.e. resistant to extreme values.\nLet’s import the needed data with this command to calculate the Mean, and Median.\n\nlibrary(readxl) \ndat &lt;- read_excel(\"Data Summary.xlsx\", sheet=\"Mean\")   \nmean(dat$X)   \n\n[1] 82.1\n\nmedian(dat$X) \n\n[1] 81\n\n\nLet’s see what happens to the Mean and Median if we mistakenly replace a number with an extreme value\n\nmean(dat$Y)  \n\n[1] 153.1\n\n\nThe extreme value distorts the Mean.\n\nmedian(dat$Y) \n\n[1] 84\n\n\nThe Median is not really affected by the extreme value because of its characteristics of resistant to extreme values.\nMeasures of central tendency are chosen based on the characteristics of the data.\n\nAll three central tendency measurements hold true for continuous data with a symmetrical distribution.

Measures of spread describe how similar or varied the set of observed values is for a specific variable (data item). Summarising the dataset can help us understand the data, especially when the dataset is large.\nVariance, standard deviation, and standard error are three of the commonly used measures of spread.\nSpread is in the context of the distribution of dataset points. A low value of spread indicates that the data points tend to be clustered tightly around the center while a high value of spread indicates the data points are far away from the center.
